Hello!
I'm building a web 2.0 blogging platform since 2018 :P

The problem I'm trying to solve is to create the first (as far as I know) fully mobile-editable, open web-publishable blog platform (hosting + editing), with no platform overhead (like the current state of Tumblr, VSCO), as to integrate with existing social media apps for showcasing extended content.

Inspired by: Classic weblogs, Tumblr blogs with themes, independent photography portfolio websites, linktrees, but also the note taking app Obsidian (accumulative writing and structuring of blog pages).
Target platform: Web â€“ mobile, social media app browsers and desktop
Hosting: AWS S3, CloudFront
Backend: Firebase
Lang: Vanilje JS, custom libs
Architecture: MVC, pub-sub with constant topics for coupling

'Klatremus' (climbing mouse) is current project iteration.
Currently launched @ snublr.net
