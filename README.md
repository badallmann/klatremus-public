Hei!

I am building a web 2.0 blogging platform since 2018 rip:P

The first cross-device && open web publishable multimedia blog platform. Integrates with existing social media as a link-in-bio site. Showcase extended content beyond current online presence. 

In the marketplace:
- No platform overhead when publishing, unlike social media
- Dead simple setup, editing and social features, unlike website generators

Inspired by: Classic weblogs, Tumblr blogs with themes, independent photography portfolio websites, linktrees, the note taking app Obsidian (accumulative writing and structuring of pages). 

Target platform: Web â€“ Mobile, desktop and social media app browsers. 

Stack: AWS S3 & CloudFront, Firebase, client side vanilla JS, custom libs.

Architecture: Serverless SPA. MVC, pub-sub with constant topics for coupling. 

'Klatremus' (climbing mouse) is current project iteration.

Currently launched @ snublr.net
