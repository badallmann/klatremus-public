Hello!

I'm building a web 2.0 blogging platform since 2018 :P 

The first 100% mobile && open web publishable multimedia blog platform. No platform overhead like the current state of Tumblr, VSCO. May be integrated with existing social media apps as a link-in-bio site. Showcase extended content. 

Inspired by: Classic weblogs, Tumblr blogs with themes, independent photography portfolio websites, linktrees, but also the note taking app Obsidian (accumulative writing and structuring of blog pages). 


Target platform: Web â€“ mobile, social media app browsers and desktop. 

Stack: AWS S3 & CloudFront, Firebase, client side vanilla JS, all custom minimalist libs.


Architecture: MVC, pub-sub with constant topics for coupling. 

'Klatremus' (climbing mouse) is current project iteration.

Currently launched @ snublr.net
